## Learning Python For Machine Learing

The code files are replete with basics of the python programming language. The instructor for the Python course is [Brad Traversy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJmcL1N2KQs&list=PLillGF-RfqbbJYRaNqeUzAb7QY-IqBKRx). Feel free to check out his channel (One of the best programmers in the world).

The starter files are also in his github repository. If you want to learn or contribute, feel free to [Starter files](https://github.com/bradtraversy/python_sandbox/tree/master/python_sandbox_starter)



I mastered the basics in this order:
>[Variables](../python_start/variables.py)
